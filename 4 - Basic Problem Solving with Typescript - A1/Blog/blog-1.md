## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

TypeScript's ability to create complex and flexible types is one of its most powerful features. Among these capabilities, union and intersection types provide developers with tools to model a wide range of data structures and enforce strong typing. In this article, we'll dive into the significance of union and intersection types in TypeScript.

# Union Types:
Union types enable a variable to hold values of different types. This flexibility allows developers to create more versatile and resilient code. This means a variable can hold values of different types at different times. They are represented using the '|' symbol.


Here the example of code: 

        type StudentId = string | number;

        function printID(id: StudentId) {
            console.log(`Student ID: ${id}`);
        }

        printID("CSE-401"); // Output: Student ID: CSE-401
        printID(401);   // Output: Student ID: 401

In this example, the StudentId type can be either a string or a number. The printID function accepts a parameter of type StudentId, allowing it to handle both string and number inputs seamlessly.

Union types are particularly useful when dealing with values that can have multiple types, such as user inputs.

# Intersection Types:
Intersection types allow developers to combine multiple types into a single type. This enables the creation of rich and complex data structures by merging the properties of different types. They are represented using the '&' symbol.


Here the example of code: 

        interface Instructor {
            name: string;
            age: number;
        }

        interface Developer {
            id: number;
            department: string;
        }

        type Info = Instructor & Developer;

        const person: Info = {
            name: "Mr. Person",
            age: 32,
            id: 4041,
            department: "Next Level Developer"
        };

In this example, the Info type is an intersection of the Instructor and Developer interfaces. It combines the properties of both interfaces into one. And now we can easily catch the all properties by using a single type.

Intersection types are useful for creating complex object types by combining existing types. They enable code reuse and provide a way to express rich data structures such as combining mixins in classes or composing different data models.
